# Atheos
Atheos is an upcoming Action RPG video game that aims to close the gap between blockchain videogames and the traditional gaming market.

We hear and understand the gaming community. We need real games, real playability, simplified platforms, token systems with purpose and actual values. Above everything else, we need games that make us want to come back to play them, for the challenges, experiences and overall enjoyment.

We want to abandon the grind feeling in games doing countless hours of playtime without any meaningful rewards.

Now every run will be meaningful with our Item Creation Engine. (ICE)

We will Fight to Create, instead of Fight to Find. Changing completely the way we grind in the RPG genre.

In Atheos the player will create unique items of metadata in the form of Non Fungible Tokens (NFT) every single successful level run.
This adds several layers of complexity and uniqueness to what most people understand when it comes to the meaning of creating your own NFT in our game.

To achieve this we base our foundation in three layers:  
The Game - Lore, art direction, gameplay, mechanics, challenges, longevity.  
Economy - What is the use case for our tokens?   
Governance - How can players contribute to the direction of the game? How do we build a platform where the voice of your players will be heard?
