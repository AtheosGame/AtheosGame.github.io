# Atheos
Atheos is an upcoming Action RPG video game that aims to close the gap between the current P2E videogames and the traditional gaming market. Atheos follows a dual token model system. We believe this is the best way to create an enjoyable and comprehensible game while supporting incentives for stakers and providing the network with decentralized governance.

Atheos RPG (ARPG) is our governance token. With ARPG, players will be able to shape the future of our platform. Users will vote on several issues, such as balance patches, new art for cosmetic items, monsters, etc…
Souls (SOULS) are our in-game currency. Souls will be earned and consumed as players play the game. Players can use Souls to trade items and acquire new dungeon maps.


## ARPG TOKEN

Atheos RPG (ARPG) is a governance token with limited supply. ARPG tokens bind the Atheos ecosystem together, blurring the lines between investors, players and developers by pooling power, responsibility, and aligning their incentives.
Users that stake ARPG will be able to determine the future of Atheos, and receive rewards while doing so.
ARPG tokens have three main use cases:
Staking: Staking ARPGs rewards users with newly minted tokens and a share of the game’s revenue. (Staking ARPGs is required to participate in the governance mechanisms)
Governance: We want to provide the Atheos community with an unprecedented opportunity to connect and interact in a constant open communication channel between developers, players and stakers. Users will be able to participate in a number of key votes that will determine the future of Atheos.
Cosmetic Store: Users will be able to buy cosmetic items directly from the store. There will be cosmetic items for characters, sanctuaries and guilds. Limited cosmetic items will be released periodically.
The following schematic represents how ARPG interacts within the Atheos ecosystem:

### SOUL TOKEN

Souls are Atheos in-game currency and will have an unlimited supply. Souls will be minted and burned as players play the game. Every time players do an in-game transaction involving Souls, a small part of that transaction will go directly into the Treasury. When burning Souls, 10% of the tokens will be transferred to the Treasury and when trading items 3% fee will be charged to the seller.


### SPENDING SOULS
Players will use Souls to buy maps. The price of the map will be proportionate to the level of the map. Higher-level maps will provide more challenging experiences and will reward players with better loot. Once the game’s economy has developed, players will be able to trade items in Atheos Marketplace using Souls.

### ACQUIRING SOULS
Players can earn Souls by completing Quests, winning PvP matches, participating in events, and can find it organically as they explore dungeons and defeat enemies. Players can also burn NFT items they own to get extra Souls. This process is called Smelting and will destroy the item permanently.
