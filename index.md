# Atheos
Atheos is an upcoming Action RPG video game that aims to close the gap between blockchain videogames and the traditional gaming market. 

We hear and understand the gaming community.  We need real games, real playability, simplified platforms, token systems that have actual purpose and value. Above everything else, we need games that makes us want to come back to them to play them for the experience, the challenge and enjoyment.

To achieve this we base our foundation in three layers: 

1) The Game - Lore, art direction, gameplay, mechanics, challenges, longevity.
2) Economy - What is the use case for our tokens?
3) Governance - How can players contribute to the direction of the game. How do we build a platform where the voice of your players will be heard?
