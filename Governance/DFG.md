# What is DFG? 

**Decentralized Fair Governance** is our aim at coming up with logical and fair systems of consensus when it comes to proposing and voting.

Governance in general has been plagued with low voter participation, plutocracy, collision and vote-buying attacks. How legitimate is a governance system if most of the community does not participate? How decentralized can a governance system be, if decisions can be controlled by a small number of colluding large investors? 

**Decentralized Fair Governance** is our attempt at moving past this issue, by creating a decentralized governance system which periodically updates with newly implemented changes proposed by the entire community. (developers, investors, players).

The following is a set of ideas and criteria that we believe any Governance system should must meet:
- Everyone must have a voice, investors and players alike.
- The governance methods must be iterative, they have to change alongside its community, while staying true to its principles.
- It must incentivize participation. (the legitimacy of a voting system is proportional to its voter participation).
- Attack vectors have to be proactively found and fixed
- Every community must be proportionally represented.
