### Introduction to Atheo's Governance:

In our path to bridge video game platforms and the blockchain world we find ourselves in an exploding movement of cultural DAOs and tools which are trying to figure out the best methods and practices to implement decentralized systems of governance.

We would like to be upfront with the following statement:

We are **not decentralized,** we are in fact, a **centralized** indie game company.   

This is how Atheos was born from concept to development, calling it otherwise would be incorrect.

We do not wish to build another DAO, for we do not feel it properly represents how we define ourselves or where we want to be.

However, the following are some of our founding questions:

- **How much can we actually decentralize and why?**
- Can we find a middle ground in order to have healthier platforms of communication between **developers** (**centralized**) and the **users** (**decentralized**)?.

The road ahead in this department is simple, we must build together the governance system alongside its users; paramount to the **longevity** of any video game platform.

The better the platform of governance is built the better the developers will be able to solve the issues and needs that are important to the most loyal user base of any video game in the future.
