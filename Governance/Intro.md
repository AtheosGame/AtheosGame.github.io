### Introduction to Atheo's Governance:

Blockchain gaming presents itself as one of the biggest paradigm shifts in gaming history. Not only for the technical advances, but for the social challenges it provides. It’s our opinion that the success of blockchain gaming will largely depend on the successful implementation of a decentralized governance.

We believe that decentralized governance must come in varying degrees, a financial product requires a level of decentralization that a game might not be able to afford. As well its worth mentioning that the attempts to fully decentralized governance through mechanisms such as coin voting end up creating plutarchies. When it comes to videogames, unchecked decentralization can unintentionally centralize power. The problems of coin voting and plutarchy can be further explored here:

We want to be upfront with the following statement:

We are not creating a DAO. We believe that currently DAOs do not provide daily users with a meaningful experience nor decentralize power efficiently.

However, the following are some of our founding questions:

- **How much can we actually decentralize and why?**
- **How can we decentralize without giving unproportionate power to wealthy investors?**
- Can we find a middle ground in order to have healthier platforms of communication between **developers** (**centralized**) and the **users** (**decentralized**)?.

We would like to be upfront with the following statement:

We are **not decentralized,** we are in fact, a **centralized** indie game company.
