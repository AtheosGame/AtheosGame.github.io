### Intro:

In our path to bridge video game platforms and the blockchain world we find ourselves in an exploding movement of cultural DAOs and tools which are trying to figure out the best methods and practices to implement decentralized systems.

We would like to start by setting the record straight:

**We are not decentralized, we are in fact, a centralized indie game company.**   

This is how Atheos was born from concept to development, calling it otherwise would be a wrong starting step in what we are trying to achieve.

We do not wish to build another DAO, for we feel it does not properly express how we define who we are or where we want to be.


Our main question is the following:  

**How much can we actually decentralize?** 

Can we find a middle ground in order to have healthier platforms of interaction between **developers** (**centralized**) and the **user** (**decentralized**)?.

The road ahead in this department is simple, we must build the governance system alongside our users.
