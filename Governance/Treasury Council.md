# Treasury Council  

The Treasury council's main job will be to represent the Atheos community and run the Treasury activities. Formed by three groups with three individuals each.

Each group will represent a different portion of the community:

·        Three members that are among $ARPG holders and stakers

·        Three members chosen among Esports and content creators

·        Three members nominated chosen by the community

Positions in the Treasury council will be time-limited, will have a lag time between potential re-elections and will be rewarded with tokens.

The responsibility of the treasury council will be the following:

·        Create problem reports (see DFG section for more)

·        Manage the game fund

·        Meet with Atheos Dev team and represent the interest of the community.

Everything else will be voted on by the community following our DFG principles.
