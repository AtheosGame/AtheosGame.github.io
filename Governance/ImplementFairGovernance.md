# Implementing Fair Governance

Creating such a system is an epic task, and we do not claim to have all the answers, nor do we want to. Our governance system will only succeed if it is created alongside our community, and not mandated by a centralized entity. 

We are here to lay the groundwork, safeguards and context needed for our governance system to flourish. To this end we are creating a number of tools and methods that will define our initial governance system, and hopefully inspire our community to further build new and better systems.

The values of **Fair Governance** will be implemented throughout **Manifestos** and **Constitutions**.
