Dungeon Maps are NFTs that can be owned and traded. 

Dungeon Maps can be purchased via the vendor NPC for a fixed [$SOULS](https://atheosgame.github.io/tokenomics/soulstoken/) price depending on the dungeon level, traded in the marketplace or traded in-game between players.

There are three types of maps:

**1. Seasonal maps:** These are not unique and can always be bought/sold at the vendor for **$SOULS**. These maps lead to the common Dungeons of the game which are linked to the current Season. 

**2. Unique maps:** These are unique maps that can be found as droppable loot during dungeon runs, they have a limited number of uses.

**3. Legendary maps:** These are maps that will only spawn during special events and will lead to extremely unique dungeons.

Maps determine all the parameters of the dungeon they lead you to, from the type of rewards you can expect to the monsters and their abilities. It is paramount to optimal item creation to take the right base items to the right dungeons. Thus, map trading will be an important part of the economy.
