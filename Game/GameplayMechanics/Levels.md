# LEVELS

Each dungeon level presents a unique challenge and a reward.

* **1st level:** The first room provides a random reward, which is always magical or better.

* **2-6th level:** They provide a random reward of any kind as determined by the dungeon.

* **7th level:** Final Boss battle, always gives a rare or better reward, and has the highest chance of dropping **Organs** and/or **Skins** (see "Shadow").
   
*Every time you enter a room, there is a 10% chance it will be a **challenge level** (20% harder) and there is a 1% chance it will be a **deadly level** (40% harder). These levels increase the rarity of the items by 20% and 40% respectively. These special levels will have their unique music score and in-game lighting.*
