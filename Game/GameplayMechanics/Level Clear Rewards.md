---
The rewards that improve items have the following levels of rarity:  
Normal, Magical, Rare, Epic and Legendary.

**Organs and Skin drops**  
In addition to the item reward, bosses might drop a skin or an organ. The chances of the drop depend on the boss and they decrease in % for each organ or skin if you already own one or more of the same type in order to incentivize trading.
 
**Stat increase rewards**   
Some rewards upgrade the values of the basic stats of the item, by a value or a percentage, depending on the reward parameters.

**Rune rewards**  
Runes are special rewards that grant abilities, resistances, specials, etc. They can combine into Words of Power, which grants additional abilities and bonuses. Additionally, runes can be powered up if you have the power up rune for it.
