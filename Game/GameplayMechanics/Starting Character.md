All players start using the characer **Shadow** from the beginning.

Players might have more than one shadow slot and **exchange** items between them.

**Shadows** have **Stats** and **Levels**, and can obtain **Organs** for **Skills** and a wide variety of **Weapons** and **Item** slots.

Finally, Shadows can imbue themselves into a **Skin** which binds their class direction which is **Soulbound**.

## Stats:
**Strength:** Determines how much damage you deal.  
**Dexterity:** Determines how likely you are to hit a critical hit, and the chance to block an enemy attack if equipped with a shield.  
**Speed:** Determines how likely you are to dodge an attack, how fast (often) you attack and how fast you move through the map.  
**Endurance:** Determines your Health amount.  
**Magic:** Determines your Mana amount.  

**Experience:**
After gaining a certain amount of experience the Shadow will level up, which will allow you to increase its stats. Leveling up becomes gradually harder and stats have a ceiling.

**Organs:**
Certain bosses will drop **Organs** which you can use to build up a body for your Shadow. Organs are permeated with the **monster's abilities**, which you will be able to use.

There are **4 types of Organs:** Cerebrums, Heart, Lung, Guts
You can use one slot for each organ type.
Each Organ will grant you a **unique ability.** (E.g. "Blaze Dragon's" lungs allow you to throw a fireball every 15' while the "Lion's heart" brings you back to life with 10% health once per dungeon run).
You can swap Organs before every run, but never during a dungeon run.

**Inventory:**
As a player, you have a **limitless inventory** in which you can store Shadows, Organs, Skins and Items.
Only equipped items will affect gameplay.
