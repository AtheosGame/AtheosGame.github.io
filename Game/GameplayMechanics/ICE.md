# Item Creation Engine - ICE


### Intro:

**Random Integer Generator - (RnG)** is a key part of item distribution in most ARPG video games.  RnG determines the mathematical chances of an item dropping as you defeat monsters.  This mechanism can give the user a very grindy experience that with time could feel too repetitive and not very rewarding.

Item theory-crafting is one of our passions.
We wanted to design an ARPG game with meaningful challenges that hopefully enhance the players experience with its environment. RnG would no longer be factor in the quality of items that the player is rewarded, and instead your skill and understanding of your own limitations will determine the quality of the rewards.

Introducing 
### **Item Creation Engine (ICE).**

**ICE is about gamifying the creation of NFTs.**

Finishing a dungeon level in Atheos will reward a new stat enhancement on an item of your selection.

Every successful level run will reward you an item. How strong your item becomes will be a combination of equipment, skill, luck and help from other players.

This will not be an easy video game. 

You will need to measure how far your chances are of completing each level, for failure will result in loosing the item you choose at the beginning of the dungeon run.

### **ICE Breakdown:**

* Choose the item you want to enhance
* 1 dungeon map = 7 levels
* 7 levels completed = 7 item enhancements
* 5 levels of rarity enhancements: Normal, Magical, Rare, Epic, Legendary (determined by RNG).
* The game generates 1 blockchain transaction at the end of the Dungeon run, minting an NFT.

Congratulations! You can now can use your new item, trade it, or smelt it at the forge for $Souls.
