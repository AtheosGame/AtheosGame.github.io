# Shadow

All players start using the main shadow character from the beginning.

Players might have more than one shadow slot and exchange items between them. Shadows have Stats and Levels, and can obtain Organs for skills and a wide variety of Weapon and Armor slots. 

Finally, Shadows can imbue themselves into a Skin which binds their class direction which is permanent.

 ## Stats

- Strength: Determines how much damage you deal.
- Dexterity: Determines how likely you are to hit a critical hit, and the chance to block an enemy attack if equipped with a shield
- Speed: Determines how likely you are to dodge an attack, how fast (often) you attack and how fast you move through the map.
- Endurance: Determines the amount of Health your character has
- Magic: Determines the amount of Mana your character has.

EXPERIENCE: After gaining a certain amount of experience, the Shadow will level up, which will allow you to increase its stats. Levelling up becomes gradually harder and stats have a ceiling.

## Organs 
Certain bosses will drop Organs which you can use to build up a body for your Shadow. Organs are permeated with the monsters’ abilities, which you will be able to use. 

There are four types of Organs: (Cerebrums, Hearts, Lungs and Guts). You can use up to one of each for your Shadow. 

Each Organ will grant you a unique ability. E.g. ‘Blaze Dragon’s lungs’ allow you to throw a fireball every 15’ while the Lion’s heart’ brings you back to life with 10% health once per run.
*You can swap Organs before every run, but never during a run.
