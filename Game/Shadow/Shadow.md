# Shadow

All players start using a shadow character from the beginning.

Players might have more than one shadow slot and exchange items between them.   

Shadows have Stats and Levels, and can obtain Organs for skills and a wide variety of Weapons and Armor slots. 

Finally, Shadows can imbue themselves into a **Skin** which binds their **class direction** which is **soulbound**.

 **Stats:**

- **Strength:** Determines how much damage you deal.
- **Dexterity:** Determines how likely you are to hit a critical hit, and the chance to block an enemy attack if equipped with a shield
- **Speed:** Determines how likely you are to dodge an attack, how fast (often) you attack and how fast you move through the map.
- **Endurance:** Determines the amount of Health your character has
- **Magic:** Determines the amount of Mana your character has.

**Experience:**     
After gaining a certain amount of experience the Shadow will level up, which will allow you to increase its stats. Leveling up becomes gradually harder and stats have a ceiling.

**Organs:**   
Certain bosses will drop Organs which you can use to build up a body for your Shadow. Organs are permeated with the monsters abilities, which you will be able to use. 

There are four types of Organs: 
**Cerebrums, Heart, Lung, Guts**     
You can use one slot for each organ type. 

Each Organ will grant you a unique ability.  (E.g. "Blaze Dragon's" lungs allow you to throw a fireball every 15' while the "Lion's heart" brings you back to life with 10% health once per dungeon run).   
*You can swap Organs before every run, but never during a dungeon run.*


**Skins:**  
Skins are the most important upgrade on a character, akin to a Class in similar games. 

Each Skin will provide you with a special ability or attack and many perceptual buffs to the skinâ€™s areas of expertise.

There are many skins, all belonging to the humanoid version of the bosses of the game, which you as a Shadow can possess after killing them. Each focuses on one of the three aspects of the game: Damage dealing, Tanking or Support abilities. Choose wisely a skin that synergies with your Organs and items.

**Inventory:**  
As a player, you have a **limitless inventory** in which you can store Shadows, Organs, Skins and Items. 

Only equipped items will affect gameplay.
