Atheos will be built by phases, starting with the single player experience and then creating private and public areas for players to gather and interact together in many ways such as trading, dueling etc.

**Dungeon Run - Single Player**

The most common game mode in which you will play on your own against the AI, entering dungeons and fighting monsters to acquire NFT items.

**Dungeon Run - Multiplayer**

The same as a dungeon run but it can be done with up to two friends. The difficulty of the dungeons will change depending on the number of players.

**Arena** - 1v1, 2v2, 3v3

An arena mode in which your teamates and you, compete against other players for reputation and rewards.  
The Arena will have different challenge modes, we will dive deeper into PvP mechanics in the future.

**Sanctuary**

This will be your personal private quarters, your home.   
This area is customizable for you to build as you discover items within the game.  
Other players will be able to see your set up but will not be able to join you unless they are invited.

**Enclave**

Enclave will be the equivalent of a Guild Hall Area.   
Guild Leaders will be in charge of setting up the base so your new members can join and participate in building unique and powerful Enclaves.
