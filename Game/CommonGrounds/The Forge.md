# The Forge

Players can access the Forge at their **Sanctuary**

The Forge has the following uses:

**Item Burning:**  
Burn items to obtain [$SOULS](https://atheosgame.github.io/tokenomics/soulstoken/).  
Players can see how many [$SOULS](https://atheosgame.github.io/tokenomics/soulstoken/) their items are worth at any given time at the Forge. 
The amount is calculated by the game, based on player demand and activity.


**Organ Merging:**   
Merge **Organs** of the same type to obtain a higher rarity version.

This action requires a [$SOULS](https://atheosgame.github.io/tokenomics/soulstoken/) fee.
