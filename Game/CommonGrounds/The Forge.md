# The Forge

Players can access the Forge at their **Sanctuary**

The Forge has the following uses:

**Item Burning:**  
Players can burn most game items into the Forge, offering a sacrifice in exchange for [$Souls](https://atheosgame.github.io/tokenomics/soulstoken/).  
Players can see how many **$Souls** their items are worth at any given time at the Forge. 
The amount is calculated by the game, based on player demand and activity.


**Organ Merging:**   
Merge **Organs** of the same type to obtain a higher rarity version.
*This action requires a small fee in Souls.*
