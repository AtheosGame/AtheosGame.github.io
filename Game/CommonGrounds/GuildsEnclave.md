## Guild's Enclave

The Enclave is a multiplayer area for **guild members** which is customizable.

The more powerful the Guild, the mightier their Enclave, which can grow from a tavern to a palace. 

Guilds will be able to organize banquets and invite other players for a limited time to show off their Enclave. 

Players can pool their resources to **customize** their Guildâ€™s Enclave. It will be up to each Guild to decide the rules of their Enclave, their moto, their banner, and if they grow big enough, they can be rewarded with unique cosmetics.
