# The Forge

Players can access the Forge at their **Sanctuary** in which they can burn items to obtain **$SOULS**, and they can merge Organs of the same type to obtain the same Organ of higher rarity.
 
**Item Burning**

Players can see how many **$SOULS** their items are worth at any given time at the Forge. 

The amount is calculated by the game, based on player demand and activity.

Alternatively, you can sell your items for **$SOULS** to other players for a price determined by you.

**CORRUPTED ITEMS:** Corrupted items work like their regular counterparts, but they cannot be burned. 

**Organ Merging** 

Players can merge several Organs of the same type to obtain an organ of the same type but of higher rarity. 

This action requires a **$SOULS** fee.
