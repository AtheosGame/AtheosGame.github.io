# Item Types

## Weapons
Used to attack, and can be one-handed or two-handed (i.e. cannot use shield with it). Weapons have their stats:

- Damage: It is a range (e.g. from 6 to 15), and each successful hit deals damage equal to one random number between that range. Modified by the character’s Strength stat.
- Reach: How far from your character model you can hit.
- Attack speed: How fast you can repeat an attack. Modified by the character’s Speed stat.
- Runes: Special abilities and modifiers (e.g. X% chances of critical damage, fire damage, or higher damage for continuous hits).

## Shields
Shields are used to block attacks. Blocking attacks is done passively. 
- Block chances: Every time you are attacked, there is a percentage of chances for your shield to block the attack. If the attack is blocked, the damage reduction from the shield is applied.
- Block area: Depending on the shield's block area it will interact with attacks coming from your sides and your behind or not.
- Speed malus: How much the shield reduces your speed.
- Damage reduction: The percentage of damage reduction you gain every time your shield blocks.
- Runes: Special abilities and modifiers.

## Armors
Armors increase your character's defence, which reduces the damage you take from attacks. This reduction is always applied (unless the attack has an ability to circumvent armor) and is passive.
- Defence: How much the armor reduces the damage you take.
- Speed malus: How much the armor reduces your speed.
- Runes: Special abilities and modifiers.

## Helmets
Helmets are a form of armor that fill a different slot in your inventory, which increases your defence against critical hits by 20%, and it obtains different types of runes than armors. Helmet runes are meant to be magic focused.

## Charms
Charms have no stats, but they can be imbued with runes that will grant you abilities and overall buffs.

## Potions
Potions are non-NFT items, they can be purchased at the marketplace directly from the game with Gold and can be found randomly in rooms. Potions can be used to recover Health or Mana.
