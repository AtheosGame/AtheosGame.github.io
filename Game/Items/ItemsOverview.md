**How to get items in Atheos:**. 
1) Item upgrades after every level completion.
2) Random drops from enemies.
3) Trading


**Base Items:**    
Players can buy or loot base items. These are non-NFT items.  
Base items are the items players choose to upgrade when they go on a Dungeon run.   
The more powerful the base, the higher the item's potential when upgraded.   
The base item determines the starting stats of the item and the number of upgrades the item can earn from runs.

**Item Name:**   
Basic Items regardless of the type have the same basic names, (eg: ‘Sword’).   
After an item upgrades, those upgrades add themselves into the name of the item, in the form of prefixes: (‘Bloody sword’), suffixes: (‘Sword of Skulls’) or both: (‘Bloody sword of Skulls’).   
These words are always linked to the upgrades the item has (e.g. ‘fire sword’ will have a rune that gives it fire properties), but the chances of upgrades including themselves into the item’s name are random and therefore items with unique names will have the added value of being a collector’s piece.

**Rarity:**   
Five levels of rarity: 
1. Normal 
2. Magical 
3. Rare 
4. Epic 
5. Legendary

Item upgrades (eg. stat upgrades and runes) also have their level of rarity, following the same format.

The level of rarity of an item is determined by the number of upgrades it has and the level of rarity of those upgrades. The level of rarity of an item is just an indicator of its possible value. The true power comes from its upgrades and how they interact among them. Therefore, players can infer the value of an object at different levels and depending on what they think it can do when synergized with other items, skins and organs.

**Item Visualization:**  
Basic items of the same type have the same visualization. Therefore, all swords look the same before they are upgraded.  
Each upgrade changes the item's visualization to represent its uniqueness.

* Increases damage on weapons will be represented by more epic looking steels. 
* Runes will be inscribed in the blade. 
* Effects like fire and lightning will revolve around the item, etc.
