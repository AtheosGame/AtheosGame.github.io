# Item Overview

Items are gained through runs in the dungeons and can be equipped to gain their bonuses. You can swap equipped items with items in your inventory before every level, but never during a battle.

## Base Items

Players can buy or loot base items. These are non-NFT items without the upgrades from a run. Base items are the items players will select to upgrade when they go on runs. The more powerful the base, the higher the item’s potential when upgraded. 

The base item determines the starting stats of the item and the number of upgrades the item can earn from runs.

## Item Name

Basic Items regardless of the type have the same basic names, such as ‘Sword’.

After an item upgrades, those upgrades can add themselves into the name of the item, in the form of prefixes (‘Fire sword’), suffixes (‘Sword of Skulls’) or both (‘Bloodied sword of the madman’). 

These words are always linked to the upgrades the item has (e.g. ‘fire sword’ will have a rune that gives it fire properties), but the chances of upgrades including themselves into the item’s name are random and therefore items with unique names will have the added value of being a collector’s piece.

## Rarity 

NFT Items (i.e. upgraded bases through a run) have five levels of rarity: 
1. Normal 
2. Magical 
3. Rare 
4. Epic 
5. Legendary

Item upgrades (i.e. stat upgrades and runes) also have their level of rarity, following the same format.

The level of rarity of an item is determined by the number of upgrades it has and the level of rarity of those upgrades. The level of rarity of an item is just an indicator of its possible value. The true power comes from its upgrades and how they interact among them. Therefore, players can infer the value of an object at different levels and depending on what they think it can do when synergized with other items, skins and organs.

## Item Visualization 

Basic items of the same type have the same visualization. Therefore, all swords look the same before they are upgraded. Each upgrade changes the item’s visualization to represent its uniqueness.

Increases on damage on weapons will be represented by more epic looking steels, runes will be inscribed in the blade, effects like fire and lightning will revolve around the item, etc.
