# GATES

There are four types of Gates:

**Stat increase:** It shows the icon of a random stat enhancement.     
(e.g. damage increase which value will depend on the reward’s rarity)

**Rune:** It shows the icon of one rune, which adds a special ability to the item.  
(e.g. ‘fire rune’ which grants fire damage to the item)

**Rarity:** It shows the icon of a rarity upgrade. Instead of adding a reward to the item, at the end of the run you can choose one of the other rewards you obtained through the run and increase its rarity.   
(e.g. increase a rare reward to an epic reward). These rooms are 10% harder and do not count towards the maximum number of rooms of the dungeon.

**Special gate:** Every time the gates are shown, there is a 1% chance of a special gate to appear. This special gate leads to an additional room; therefore, the run will have 8 rooms. This room is harder and the reward has a higher % chance of being Epic or Legendary.
