# Maps
Dungeon Maps are NFTs that can be owned and traded. 

Dungeon Maps can be purchased via the vendor NPC for a fixed soul price depending on the dungeon level, traded in the marketplace or traded in-game between players.

There are three types of maps:
1. Seasonal maps: These are not unique and can always be bought at the vendor with $SOULS. These maps lead to the common Dungeons of the game. Any number of players can use them and repeat them as many times as they wish.
2. Unique maps: These are unique maps that can be found as droppable loot during dungeon runs, they have a limited number of uses.
3. Legendary maps: These are maps that will only spawn during special events and will lead to extremely unique dungeons.

Maps determine all the parameters of the dungeon they lead you to, from the type of rewards you can expect to the monsters and their abilities. It is paramount to optimal item creation to take the right base items to the right dungeons. Thus, map trading will be an important part of the economy.

## Gates

There are four  types of Gates:

1. Stat increase: It shows the icon of a random stat of the item, which would be increased by the reward after this door (e.g. damage increase which value will depend on the reward’s rarity).
2. Rune: It shows the icon of one rune, which adds a special ability to the item (e.g. ‘fire rune’ which grants fire damage to the item).
3. Rarity upgrade: It shows the icon of a rarity upgrade. Instead of adding a reward to the item, at the end of the run you can choose one of the other rewards you obtained through the run and increase its rarity (e.g. increase a rare reward to an epic reward). These rooms are 10% harder and do not count towards the maximum number of rooms of the dungeon.
4. Special gate: Every time the gates are shown, there is a 1% chance of a special gate to appear. This special gate leads to an additional room; therefore, the run will have 8 rooms. This room is harder and the reward has a higher % chance of being Epic or Legendary.
