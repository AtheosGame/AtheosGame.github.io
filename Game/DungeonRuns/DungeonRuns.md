# THE DUNGEON RUN
**Core game loop**: 

* Use **$SOULS** to buy **Dungeon Maps** from the game's NPCs or through trading.  
(Initiation map cost = 0)   
* Choose **one item** you wish to enhance for the selected dungeon map run.  
* Clear up to **7 levels** to add up to seven unique modifiers to said item.  
* Keep the **NFT item** after a successful level clear or continue at your own risk.

**Player Journey:**

1. **USE DUNGEON MAP:** Use a Map that leads to a specific dungeon with specific characteristics, each dungeon has a theme and a unique Boss.
 
2. **ITEM CHOICE:** Choose a base item you wish to upgrade. If you are successful in your dungeon level, you will obtain an NFT item with the chosen upgrades.
 
3. **FIRST LEVEL BATTLE:** You must fight random monsters in a procedurally generated level for the first reward. Upon defeating all the enemies, you gain the reward.
  
4. **FIRST LEVEL REWARD:** The first reward is random, with higher rarity chances than usual, which will make the item more desirable and encourage you to continue. After accepting the reward, you will be presented with 3 different Gates.
 
5. **GATES:** You are presented with three gates, each leading to a different level and a different reward type. You cannot go back, so deciding the right gate is an important choice for item building. 
Each gate has an icon, which tells you the type of reward you can expect:
(e.g. you are presented with the following three gates: ‘Damage increase’, ‘Fire rune’, ‘Lightning rune’).  
You cannot know the rarity of the reward from looking at the gate, only the type. Alternatively, at this point you can choose to exit the dungeon.
 
6. **NEXT LEVEL:** After your Gate selection, you enter a new procedurally generated level with random enemies, which you must defeat to gain the level's reward and be presented with three new gates leading to the next level. These steps are repeated 5 more times until you are led to the Boss's final level (for a total of 7 levels per dungeon map).

7. **BOSS GATES:** The gates leading to the boss's level are different, letting you know, so you can mentally prepare for what is to come. These rewards will be of higher rarity. Additionally, the boss might drop an **Organ** or a **Skin** in addition to the level's reward.
 
8. **MINT ITEM:** After finishing the run by killing the Final Boss or by exiting the Dungeon level early, you gain the upgraded item.
**By playing, you will be creating unique NFTs.**

**DEATH:** If at any point you die, you leave the Dungeon without the item. You do not lose anything else, but you do not recover **$SOULS** spent to enter.
