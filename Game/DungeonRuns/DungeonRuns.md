# THE DUNGEON RUN
The core game loop is as follows:  
Use $SOULS to buy Dungeon Maps from the game's NPCs or through trading. (Initiation map cost = 0)       
Choose 1 item you wish to enhance for the selected dungeon map run.  
Clear up to 7 levels to add up to seven unique modifiers to said item.  
Mint and keep the NFT item after a level clear success or continue at your own risk but remember, if you fail before you complete the level your item will be lost forever.

A dungeon run has the following steps, always in this order:
1. USE DUNGEON MAP: Use a Map that leads to a specific dungeon with specific characteristics, each dungeon has a theme and a unique Boss.
2. ITEM CHOICE: Choose a base item to upgrade during the dungeon run. If you are successful in your run, you will obtain the item with the upgrades you gained.
3. FIRST LEVEL BATTLE: You must fight random minions in a procedurally generated room for the first reward. Upon defeating all the enemies, you gain the reward. 
4. FIRST LEVEL REWARD: The first reward is random, but it is always more likely to be of better rarity than usual, which will make the item more desirable and encourage you to continue on. After accepting the reward, you are presented with the gates to continue.
5. GATES: You are presented with three gates, each leading to a different level with a different reward and with the exit gate. You can never go back, so deciding the right gates is an important choice for item building. Each gate will have an icon, which tells you the type of reward you can expect in the next room (e.g. you might be presented with the following three rooms in a run to gain a sword: ‘Damage increase’, ‘Fire rune’, ‘Lightning rune’). But, you cannot know the level of rarity of the reward from looking at the gate. Alternatively, if you choose the exit gate, move to the last step of the run (‘gain item’); you leave the run with the item.  
6. NEXT LEVEL: After selecting a Gate, you enter a new procedurally generated level with random enemies, which you must defeat to gain the level's reward and be presented with three new gates leading to the next room. These steps are repeated 5 more times until you are led to the Boss's room (for a total of 7 levels per dungeon map).
7. BOSS GATES: The gates leading to the boss room are different, letting you know, so you can mentally prepare for what is to come. The reward has better chances of being of higher rarity too. Additionally, the boss might drop an Organ or a Skin in addition to the room’s reward.
8. MINT ITEM: After finishing the run by killing the Final Boss or by exiting the Dungeon level early, you gain the item with all of its rewards built into it. 
By playing, you have created a unique NFT.
9. DEATH: If at any point you die, you leave the Dungeon without the item. You do not lose anything else, but you do not recover $SOULS spent to enter.
