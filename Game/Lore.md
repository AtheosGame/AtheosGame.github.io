You are a damned soul, trapped forever in the Underworld. Or so you thought, for one day after millennia, for the first time, the gates of the Underworld open before your eyes. The Guardians are nowhere to be seen, and the God of the Dead has disappeared without notice.

You are one among thousands of souls and hellish creatures to escape. Hell has broken loose, and the World is filled with its cursed scourge. 

Creatures take over temples, dungeons, and cities that now lay in ruin - for where the living lived, now rules the dead. 

Where are the Gods? Vanished. 

What are we to do? You do not care what the living do. 

You are a bodiless soul, an ethereal remnant of ether, floating through hunted lands searching for one thing and one thing only: 

A new skin to inhabit.

As you defeat creatures and enemies of all kinds, you test their bodies, but they are weak and fall to dust under the strain of your powerful soul. You must hunt bigger prey, more powerful monsters, more valiant heroes.  Those wearing skins worthy of you.

Meanwhile, the world burns. 

Maybe youâ€™ll discover why during your search.
