# GAMEPLAY 
Atheos is a dungeon crawling action role-playing, hack-and-slash video game.
You control a Shadow as it attempts to obtain a skin. A shapeless being that has spent so much time in the Underworld that it has forgotten all about who they were before. 
All shadows begin the game being the same, and you must venture into dungeons to acquire body parts to regain a physical body and to forge powerful items to help you in your quests.

The game is played through runs across procedurally generated multi-level dungeons. Each run is performed to obtain an item. This item is revealed at the beginning of the run in its most basic form, and each room you clear adds one irremovable upgrade to it, the more levels you clear the more upgrades it will have and the more unrepeatable it will be; you gain the item if you stop the run after clearing a level or finish the whole dungeon. Therefore, each run provides you with a unique NFT item to use or trade.
The game is presented in an isometric view with you in control of the Shadow. You start a run-through of the dungeon by trying to fight your way through a number of levels; the levels are procedurally generated and the enemies within them are random. The game has a hack and slash combat system. You can move, dash and attack, which can be melee or ranged depending on your weapon, and you can trigger abilities, which will vary depending on your character and items.

After choosing to initiate a run, you are presented with 3 random objects to run for, these objects are among the pool of basic items (vanilla versions) which are not yet unique.
Upon selecting which item you want to run for, you are sent to clear level, each level entails a battle, and clearing the level reaps a reward (i.e. an upgrade to the item of the run). After clearing a level and obtaining the reward, you are presented with three gates to continue to the next level, or you can choose to finish the run there if you are happy with how your item has developed and/or fear you wonâ€™t be able to clear another level. The gates have an icon showing the type of reward you may earn if you complete the next room, ranging from stat increases to the item or runes, which grant special abilities and powers to the item, and can be combined into Words of Power (which create more special abilities). But, if you die, you automatically exit the dungeon and lose the item you were running for. Nothing else is lost.

Health and Mana are maintained from room to room, therefore careful management of these resources is paramount. The cooldown of abilities is restored, to avoid forcing players to become idle players before finishing a clear.
