# GAME INTRO 
Atheos is a dungeon crawling action role-playing, hack-and-slash video game.
You control a Shadow as it attempts to obtain a skin. A shapeless being that has spent so much time in the Underworld that it has forgotten all about who they were before. 
All players begin the game with the same character, a Shadow. 
You must venture into dungeons to acquire body parts to regain a physical body and to forge powerful items to help you in your journey.


# GAMEPLAY & MECHANICS

The game is presented in an isometric view with you in control of the Shadow. You start a run-through of the dungeon by fighting your way through a number of levels and the challenges within; the levels are procedurally generated and the enemies within them are random. 

The game has a hack and slash combat system. You can move, dash and attack, which can be melee or ranged depending on your weapon, and you can trigger abilities, which will vary depending on your character and items.

After choosing to initiate a run, you are presented with 3 random objects to run for, these objects are among the pool of basic items (vanilla versions) which are not yet unique.

Every successful level completion is performed to enhance an item as the objective.

Each level you clear adds one irremovable upgrade to it, the more levels you clear the more upgrades it will have. (Up to 7)

Each time you succeed a level run you will be rewarded an unique NFT item which you can use, trade or smelt.  But, if you die, you automatically exit the dungeon and lose the item you were running for. Nothing else is lost.

Health and Mana are maintained from room to room, therefore careful management of these resources is paramount to survival. 
The cooldown of abilities is restored, to avoid forcing players to become idle players before the start of the next level.
