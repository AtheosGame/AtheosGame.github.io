# The Forge

Players can access the Forge at their base camp in which they can burn items to obtain $SOULS, and they can merge Organs of the same type to obtain a copy of the same Organ of higher rarity.
 
## Item Burning

Players can see how many $SOULS their items are worth at any given time at the Forge. 

The amount is calculated by the game based on player demand and activity.

Alternatively, you can sell your items for $SOULS to other players for a price determined by you (which does not have to match the burning price).

CORRUPTED ITEMS: Corrupted items work like their regular counterparts, but they cannot be burned. 

## Organ Merging 

Players can merge several Organs of the same type to obtain an organ of the same type but higher rarity. 

This action requires a $SOULS fee.
