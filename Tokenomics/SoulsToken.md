# Souls
Souls are Atheos in-game currency and will have an unlimited supply.
Souls will be minted and burned as players play the game. Every time players do an in-game transaction involving Souls, a small part of that transaction will go directly into the Treasury. When burning Souls, 10% of the tokens will be transferred to the Treasury and when trading items 3% fee will be charged to the seller.

## Spending Souls
Players will use Souls to buy maps. The price of the map will be proportionate to the level of the map. Higher-level maps will provide more challenging experiences and will reward players with better loot. Once the gameâ€™s economy has developed, players will be able to trade items in Atheos Marketplace using Souls

## Acquiring Souls

Players can earn Souls by completing Quests, winning PvP matches, participating in events, and can find it organically as they explore dungeons and defeat enemies. 
Players can also burn NFT items they own to get extra Souls. This process is called Smelting and will destroy the item permanently. 

## Souls Events
Every time a player spends Souls to buy a map 10% of the cost will go into the treasury Key Counter Reservoir (KCR), with the rest of the tokens being burned. Once the KCR reaches a specified threshold, a Treasury event will take place. 
Treasury events will feature limited content, namely event enemies. Defeating event enemies will reward the players with an appropriate amount of Souls from the KCR and ranking points. Once the KCR reaches zero, the event will end and rankings will be published.

The Treasury threshold will change after each successful event. If players complete the event too quickly, the threshold will increase, and vice-versa. Thus, ensuring that the duration of the event is proportionate with the player base.
