# $SOULS TOKEN
**$SOULS** are Atheos in-game currency which will have an unlimited supply. This token will be minted and burned as players progress through the game.  

## **Spending $SOULS**   
Players will spend **$SOULS** to buy **Dungeon Maps**. Dungeon Maps price will be proportionate to the level of the map. Higher-level maps will provide more challenging experiences and will reward players with better loot. 

Every time a player does an in-game transaction **10% of the token's spent** will be transferred back to the **Treasury**.

*Once the game's economy has developed, players will be able to trade items in Atheos Marketplace using **$SOULS**.*

**Acquiring $SOULS**  
Players can earn Souls by completing Quests, winning PvP matches, participating in events, and can find it organically as they explore dungeons and defeat enemies. 
Players can also burn NFT items they own to get extra Souls. This process is called Smelting and will destroy the item permanently.
