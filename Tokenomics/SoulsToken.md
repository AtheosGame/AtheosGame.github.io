# SOULS Token
**$SOULS** are Atheos in-game currency and have an unlimited supply. This token will be minted and burned as players progress through the game.  

### **Spending $SOULS**   
Players will spend **$SOULS** to buy **Dungeon Maps**. The price of these maps will be proportionate to the level of the map. Higher-level maps provide more challenging experiences and will offer with better loot rewards. 

Every time a player does an in-game transaction **10% of the token's spent** will be transferred back to the **Treasury**.

*Once the game's economy has developed, players will be able to trade items in Atheos Marketplace using **$SOULS**.*

### **Acquiring $SOULS**  
Players can earn **$SOULS** by completing Quests, winning PvP matches, participating in events, and can find it organically as they explore dungeons and defeat enemies. 

Players can **smelt** the items, burning them in exchange for **$SOULS**.  This process is done at **The Forge**, which will destroy the item permanently.
