# SOULS
**$SOULS** are Atheos in-game currency and will have an unlimited supply.
**$SOULS** will be minted and burned as players play the game. Every time a player does an in-game transaction involving **$SOULS**, a small part of that transaction will go directly into the **Treasury**. When burning **$SOULS**, **10% of the tokens** will be transferred to the **Treasury** and when trading items **3% fee** will be charged to the seller.

**Spending Souls**
Players will use **$Souls** to buy maps. The price of the map will be proportionate to the level of the map. Higher-level maps will provide more challenging experiences and will reward players with better loot. Once the gameâ€™s economy has developed, players will be able to trade items in Atheos Marketplace using Souls

**Acquiring $SOULS**

Players can earn Souls by completing Quests, winning PvP matches, participating in events, and can find it organically as they explore dungeons and defeat enemies. 
Players can also burn NFT items they own to get extra Souls. This process is called Smelting and will destroy the item permanently.
