# ARPG Token

Atheos RPG ($ARPG) is a governance token with limited supply.
$ARPG tokens bind the Atheos ecosystem together, blurring the lines between investors, players and developers by pooling power, responsibility, and aligning their incentives. 

Users that stake $ARPG will be able to determine the future of Atheos, and receive rewards while doing so. 

$ARPG tokens have three main use cases: 

 - Staking:  Staking $ARPGs rewards users with newly minted tokens and a share of the gameâ€™s revenue. (Staking $ARPGs is required to participate in the governance mechanisms) 

 - Governance: We want to provide the Atheos community with an unprecedented opportunity to connect and interact in a constant open communication channel between developers, players and stakers. Users will be able to participate in a number of key votes that will determine the future of Atheos. 	

 - Cosmetic Store:  Users will be able to buy cosmetic items directly from the store.  There will be cosmetic items for characters, sanctuaries and guilds. Limited cosmetic items will be released periodically.

## Supply
$ARPG will have a limited total supply of 100 Million tokens.  $ARPG will be issued over a five-year course, following a predetermined schedule. The initial circulating supply will be of precisely 22.700.000 tokens, 22.7% of the total supply,  and it will grow up to 100 million tokens over a period of 62 months. The following schematic represents how $ARPG interacts within the Atheos ecosystem:
