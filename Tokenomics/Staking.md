# STAKING
What is Staking? Staking is the process of committing tokens into a smart contract, done to showcase long term support for a product. Stakers receive various rewards for their support, usually in the form of newly minted tokens. Most projects offer a variety of ‘Lock’ opportunities, where you lock your tokens to increase the rewards proportional to the lock period.
