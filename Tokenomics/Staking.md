# Staking
**What is Staking?**  
Staking is the process of committing tokens into a **smart contract**, done to showcase long term support for a product. Stakers will receive various rewards for their support, in the form of newly minted tokens. Atheos offers a variety of "Lock" opportunities, where you lock your tokens to increase the rewards proportionally to the locking period.   

[$ARPG](https://atheosgame.github.io/tokenomics/arpgtoken/) holders will be able to stake their tokens and receive the following rewards:
- Access to the [governance system](https://atheosgame.github.io/governance/fairgovernance/), allowing users to actively shape the future of Atheos.
- Earn **$ARPG** as a reward for the long term commitment.  
- **40% of all** **$ARPG** that will ever exist will be distributed as staking rewards. 
- Once the game matures a Revenue Distribution scheme [(RevDis)](https://atheosgame.github.io/tokenomics/treasury/) will be implemented.
