# Game Fund

The game fund will be used as a marketing tool to acquire new players and reward existing players. Tokens inside the fund will be used in the following ways:

- In-game rewards
- Tournaments
- Governance rewards
- Airdrops
- Giveaways. 

To ensure transparency, the Atheos team will present mission statements and quarterly results. This report will disclose all financial transactions of the fund, alongside KPIs and all relevant metrics. Once the RevDis stage kicks off, the fund will be controlled by the Treasury Council and will receive a percentage of the RevDis.
