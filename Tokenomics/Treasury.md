# Treasury

The Treasury is the main **Governance** institution in Atheos. 

Most of the governance functions will start under the control of Atheos development team, and its governance will be gradually decentralized. (For further details refer to the [DFG](https://atheosgame.github.io/governance/fairgovernance/).) 

The Treasury will govern the following functions:  
- [Treasury council:](https://atheosgame.github.io/governance/treasury-council/)  The Treasury council's main job will be to represent the community that elected them and run the Treasury activities.
- [Treasury Events:](https://atheosgame.github.io/tokenomics/soulstoken/) Treasury events will trigger special dungeon challenges that are generated each time the player base spends a certain amount of $ARPGs.
- [Game Fund:](https://atheosgame.github.io/tokenomics/gamefund/) The game fund will be used to pay for tournaments, airdrops, governance rewards and other events. Initially, the fund will receive a small percentage of the total token supply, later on, it will receive a percentage of the **RevDis**.
- **Revenue Distribution Scheme (RevDis):** Once implemented the treasury fund will be responsible for the Revenue Distribution scheme (RevDis).
