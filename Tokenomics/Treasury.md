# Treasury

The Treasury is the main **Governance** institution in Atheos. 

Most of the governance functions will start under the control of Atheos development team, and its governance will be gradually decentralized. (For further details refer to the [DFG](https://atheosgame.github.io/governance/fairgovernance/).) 

The Treasury will govern the follwing functions:  
- **Treasury council.** The Treasury council's main job will be to represent the community that elected them and run the Treasury activities.
- [Staking pools:](https://atheosgame.github.io/tokenomics/staking/) and their rewards.
- [Treasury Events:](https://atheosgame.github.io/tokenomics/soulstoken/) Treasury events will trigger special dungeon challenges that are generated each time the player base spends a certain amount of $Souls.
- [Game Fund:](https://atheosgame.github.io/tokenomics/gamefund/) The game fund will be used to pay for tournaments, airdrops, governance rewards and other events. Initially, the fund will receive a small percentage of the total token supply, later on, it will receive a percentage of the **RevDis**.
- **Revenue Distribution Scheme (RevDis).** Once implemented the treasury fund will be responsible for the Revenue Distribution scheme (RevDis). The treasury fund will be financed through marketplace fees.



#### Treasury Vault:
- **Game Fund:** The game fund will be managed by the Treasury Council. 
- **Esports events:** Events that will happen periodically, managed both by the Atheos team and the Treasury Council.
- 
#### Revenue Distribution: 
At fixed intervals, a fixed percentage of the money inside the Vault will be used to buy [$ARPG](https://atheosgame.github.io/tokenomics/arpgtoken/) from the market, and then airdropped as a reward to all stakers.  The Treasury will govern the percentage and time intervals in the RevDis scheme. RevDis will be a permanent function of the game once it is fully deployed.

*When the game has reached its growth stage we will begin the revenue distribution stage. Gradually the marketplace fees will go from funding the development of the game to solely funding the treasury vault.*
