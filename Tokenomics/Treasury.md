# Treasury

The Treasury is the main Governance institution in Atheos. Most of the governance functions will start under the control of Atheos' development team, and its governance will be gradually decentralized. (For further details refer to the DeGov section.) The treasury will govern the functioning of:
- Staking pools and their rewards.
- Souls Events. Souls events are ongoing challenges that are generated each time the player base spends a certain amount of Souls.
- Game Fund. The game fund will be used to pay for tournaments, airdrops, governance rewards and other events. Initially, the fund will receive a small percentage of the total token supply, later on, it will receive a percentage of the RevDis.
- Revenue Distribution. Once implemented the treasury fund will be responsible for the Revenue Distribution scheme (RevDis). The treasury fund will be financed through marketplace fees.



## Treasury Vault and Revenue Distribution

When the game has reached its growth stage we will begin the Revenue distribution stage. Gradually the marketplace fees will go from funding the development of the game to solely funding the treasury vault. This vault will fund the following:
- Game Fund: The game fund (explained here) will be managed by the treasury. 
- Esports events. Events will happen periodically, managed both by the Atheos team and the Treasury.
- Revenue Distribution: At fixed intervals, a fixed percentage of the money inside the Vault will be used to buy $ARPG from the market, and then airdropped as a reward to all stakers.  The Treasury will govern the percentage and time intervals in the RevDis scheme. RevDis will be a permanent function of the game once it is fully deployed.


## Souls Events

Every time a player spends Souls to buy a map 10% of the cost will go into the treasury Key Counter Reservoir (KCR), with the rest of the tokens being burned. Once the KCR reaches a specified threshold, a Treasury event will take place. Treasury events will feature limited content, namely event enemies. Defeating event enemies will reward the players with an appropriate amount of Souls from the KCR and ranking points. Once the KCR reaches zero, the event will end and rankings will be published.

The Treasury threshold will change after each successful event. If players complete the event too quickly, the threshold will increase, and vice-versa. Thus, ensuring that the duration of the event is proportionate with the player base. 

The fee percentages, the types and flavour of events will all be subject to Treasury Governance
