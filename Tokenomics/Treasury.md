# Treasury

The Treasury is the main Governance institution in Atheos. Most of the governance functions will start under the control of Atheos' development team, and its governance will be gradually decentralized. (For further details refer to the DeGov section.) The treasury will govern the functioning of:
- Staking pools and their rewards.
- Souls Events. Souls events are ongoing challenges that are generated each time the player base spends a certain amount of Souls.
- Game Fund. The game fund will be used to pay for tournaments, airdrops, governance rewards and other events. Initially, the fund will receive a small percentage of the total token supply, later on, it will receive a percentage of the RevDis.
- Revenue Distribution. Once implemented the treasury fund will be responsible for the Revenue Distribution scheme (RevDis). The treasury fund will be financed through marketplace fees.



## Treasury Vault and Revenue Distribution

When the game has reached its growth stage we will begin the Revenue distribution stage. Gradually the marketplace fees will go from funding the development of the game to solely funding the treasury vault. This vault will fund the following:
- Game Fund: The game fund (explained here) will be managed by the treasury. 
- Esports events. Events will happen periodically, managed both by the Atheos team and the Treasury.
- Revenue Distribution: At fixed intervals, a fixed percentage of the money inside the Vault will be used to buy $ARPG from the market, and then airdropped as a reward to all stakers.  The Treasury will govern the percentage and time intervals in the RevDis scheme. RevDis will be a permanent function of the game once it is fully deployed.
