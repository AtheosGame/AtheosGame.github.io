# Tokenomics

Atheos uses a dual model token:

Atheos RPG ([$ARPG](https://atheosgame.github.io/tokenomics/arpgtoken/)) is our governance token. With **$ARPG**, players will be able to shape the future of our platform. Users will be encouraged to participate on several issues, such as balance patches, new art for cosmetic items, monsters and more.

Souls ([$SOULS](https://atheosgame.github.io/tokenomics/soulstoken/)) is our in-game currency token. **$SOULS** will be earned and consumed as players play the game. Players can use **$SOULS** to trade items and acquire new dungeon maps.
