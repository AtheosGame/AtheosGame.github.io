# Overview
Atheos is a **dungeon crawling** action role-playing, **hack-and-slash** video game.  

You control a **Shadow** (Character) as it attempts to obtain a **skin** (Class). A shapeless being that has spent so much time in the Underworld that it has forgotten all about who they were before.  

You must venture into dungeons to acquire body parts to regain a physical body and to forge powerful items to help you in your journey.

The game is presented in an **isometric view** with you in control of the Shadow. You start the dungeon by fighting your way through a number of **levels** and the challenges within; the levels are procedurally generated and the enemies are randomized according to the dungeons level. 

The game has a **hack-and-slash** combat system. You can move, dash and attack, which can be melee or ranged depending on your weapon, and you can trigger abilities, which will vary depending on your character and items.

Atheos gameplay is full of challenging **levels** within each **dungeon map**.  

**Every successful level completion enhances your item by adding one irremovable upgrade.**

If you leave the dungeon alive your upgraded item will become a unique **NFT** which you can use, trade or burn. 

However, if you die, you automatically exit the dungeon and lose the item you were running for. Nothing else is lost.

**Health** and **Mana** are maintained from level to level, therefore careful management of these resources is paramount to survival. The cooldown of the abilities are restored to avoid forcing players to become idle before the start of the next level.
